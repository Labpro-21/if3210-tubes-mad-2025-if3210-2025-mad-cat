# Purrytify Sharing Features Implementation

## Overview
I've successfully implemented both requested features for your Purrytify app:

1. **Share Songs via URL** - Users can share songs through deep links
2. **Share Songs via QR** - Users can share songs using QR codes

## Features Implemented

### 1. Share Songs via URL
- ✅ Deep link format: `purrytify://song/<song_id>`
- ✅ Share button in mini-player, full-player, and menu
- ✅ Android ShareSheet integration
- ✅ Automatic clipboard copy functionality
- ✅ Handles both local and online songs

### 2. Share Songs via QR
- ✅ QR code generation for song sharing
- ✅ Visual preview with song title and artist
- ✅ Share QR as image through Android ShareSheet
- ✅ QR scanner functionality accessible from home screen
- ✅ Camera permission handling
- ✅ Deep link validation

## Key Components Added/Modified

### 1. Dependencies (build.gradle.kts)
```kotlin
// QR Code Generation
implementation("com.google.zxing:core:3.5.3")
implementation("com.journeyapps:zxing-android-embedded:4.3.0")

// Camera for QR Code scanning
implementation("androidx.camera:camera-camera2:1.3.1")
implementation("androidx.camera:camera-lifecycle:1.3.1")
implementation("androidx.camera:camera-view:1.3.1")
implementation("com.google.mlkit:barcode-scanning:17.2.0")
```

### 2. AndroidManifest.xml
- Added deep link intent filter for `purrytify://song` scheme
- Added FileProvider for sharing images
- Camera permission already included

### 3. New Components
- `ShareSongDialog.kt` - Dialog showing both URL and QR code options
- `QRScannerScreen.kt` - Full-screen QR scanner with camera permissions

### 4. Modified Components
- `MusicPlayerScreen.kt` - Added share button in menu
- `MiniPlayer.kt` - Added share button
- `HomeScreen.kt` - Added QR scanner button
- `MainActivity.kt` - Added deep link handling
- `TrendingApiService.kt` - Added getSongById endpoint

## How It Works

### Sharing Flow
1. User taps share button (available in mini-player, full-player, and menu)
2. Share dialog appears showing:
   - QR code preview
   - Deep link URL with copy button
   - Share QR button
   - Share URL button
3. User can either:
   - Copy the URL to clipboard
   - Share the URL via Android ShareSheet
   - Share the QR code as an image

### QR Scanning Flow
1. User taps QR scanner icon in home screen
2. Camera permission requested if not granted
3. Camera preview opens with QR scanning
4. When valid Purrytify QR code detected:
   - Song is fetched from API
   - Song starts playing
   - User is navigated to player screen

### Deep Link Handling
1. When app receives deep link `purrytify://song/<song_id>`:
2. MainActivity intercepts the intent
3. Fetches song data from API
4. Plays the song and navigates to player

## Validation & Error Handling
- ✅ Validates QR codes are from Purrytify
- ✅ Shows error messages for invalid QR codes
- ✅ Handles both local and online songs
- ✅ Camera permission handling with user-friendly prompts
- ✅ Online songs can now be shared (previously restricted)

## Best Practices Implemented
- Proper permission handling for camera
- Resource cleanup in QR scanner
- Error messages for user feedback
- Accessibility considerations
- Efficient QR code generation
- Proper deep link validation

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test sharing local songs
2. Test sharing online songs
3. Test QR scanning with valid/invalid codes
4. Test deep links from other apps
5. Test camera permission flow
6. Test on different Android versions

The implementation follows Android best practices and provides a seamless sharing experience for your users!
